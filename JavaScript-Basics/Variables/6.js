/* This exercise is very similar to the previous one. We declare a variable called num, assign it a value of 5, and try to log it. But again, we introduced a small mistake.
Fix the code and run it. */

/*INICIAL CODE:

console.log(num);
const num = 5;
*/

//REFACTORADE CODE:
const num = 5;
console.log(num);
