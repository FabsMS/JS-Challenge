/* In this exercise we practice how to declare a new variable and how to assign it a number. The console.log() statement below attempts to log a variable named num.
Declare a variable with this name and assign it a number of your choice. Run the code to see if the number is being logged. */

/*INICIAL CODE:


console.log('The value of num is: ' + num);
*/

//REFACTORADE CODE:
const num = 3;
console.log('The value of num is:' + num);
